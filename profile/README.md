## 💡 Our Philosophy

We believe that high-quality technical education should be accessible, unbiased, and practical. 

* **Zero-Cost Education:** All core learning materials are free, removing financial barriers to entry.
* **Built in Public:** We document our infrastructure—from self-hosting on Ubuntu to managing Keycloak SSO—so others can learn from our journey.
* **Integrity-First:** No ads, no affiliate links, and no sponsored content. Our guidance is driven by what actually works in production.
* **Sustainable Tech:** Our insights are funded by real-world consulting and technology services, creating a feedback loop between the industry and the classroom.

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Projects

We focus on modern, scalable, and self-hosted infrastructure:
* **Cloud & Infra:** Docker, Docker Compose, Kubernetes, Cloudflare.
* **Identity:** Keycloak (OIDC/SSO).
* **Web:** Astro (Static Site Generation), Moodle (LMS).
* **Backend/DevOps:** Linux (Ubuntu Server/Desktop), CI/CD workflows.
